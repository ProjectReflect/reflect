# Reflect
This repository contains the code for the Reflect Frontend Web Application to run on the Smart Mirror Hardware.

Reflect superimposes information on a reflection of the user, allowing users to multitask. The user has access to the time, date, weather, their calendar, estimated time of arrival to work (Google Maps driven), estimated Uber cost, stocks, news headlines, measured weight, calculated body-mass index, calories burned throughout the day (Google Fit API driven, to be implemented), and an estimated energy level. The user can access all this information at a glance hands-free. The mirror uses a LEAP motion sensor to let the user switch between two panes with a simple swipe.

While you're brushing your teeth, fixing your tie, or doing your hair, you can focus on what's important - the day ahead.
